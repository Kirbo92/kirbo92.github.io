                <h2>Use it on the smartphone <br> you want whether <br> is big, small or even if it has <br> a protective case</h2>
                <p>Playloop adapts itself to most Android smartphones on the market. All phones with USB-OTG support and bottom centered connection are compatible. Fitting dimensions come from 68 to 84mm wide. You  donÂ´t have to remove the protective case every time you want to play either. <em>*(protective cases up to 2mm thick).</em>  </p>

                <p> <strong>3D printing FDM</strong> has been one of the most revolutionary technologies of last decade and we've bet on it.
